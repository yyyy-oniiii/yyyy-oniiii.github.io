# [Math | Algebra] Graphing lines and slope

## `🧭Recall`
<br>

#### 🧙‍♂️ **Linear Equation**
```java
    "y = 2x - 3"
    
    if {
        x = 0, y = -3
        x = 1, y = -1
        x = 2, y = +1
        .
        .
        .
    }

```

<br><br>

## `📜Note`

- **variable equations**
```java
    
    "Q.Which of the ordered pairs is a solution of the following equation?"

    -3x - y = 6

    (1) only (-4, 4) 
    (2) only (-3, 3) 
    (3) both
    (4) neither


```

- **slope**
> increase in vertical / increase in horizontal <br>
= slope <br>
> = 🔺(delta) x / 🔺(delta) y <br>
= change in x / change in y<br>
> <br>
> **higher the slope means the steeper it is**
